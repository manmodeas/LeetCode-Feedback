<!-- Example    
1. Two Sum https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
-->
55. Jump Game https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/description/


### Category of the bug
- [*] Incorrect test Case *(Output of test case is incorrect as per the problem statement)*


### Description of the bug
Problem Statement : You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

nums = [5,9,3,2,1,0,2,3,3,1,0,0] this was the Input Test Case.
Expected Output showing "True" but as per the problem statement it should be false.


### Language used for code
C#


### Code used for Submit/Run operation

```
public class Solution {
    public bool CanJump(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.Length == 1)
            return true;
        if(nums[0] == 0)
            return false;
        int newStart = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.Length; )
        {    
            if((i + nums[i]) >= nums.Length - 1)
                return true;
            int maxJump = 0;
            for(int j = i + nums[i]; j > i; j--){
                if(j + nums[j] >= nums.Length - 1)
                    return true;
                if(nums[j + nums[j]] > 0 && maxJump < j + nums[j]){
                    maxJump = j + nums[j];
                }
                    
            }
            if(maxJump == 0)
                return false;
            else
                i = maxJump;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```


### Expected behavior
The Output of The Input Test Case mentioned in " Description of the bug" Should be 'False' as per the Problem Statement becasue it it can't reach the last index.


### Screenshots
I was not able to paste Screenshot here. Let me know how to do it. So next time I can add the screenshots as well.
